# Changelog

## 1.0.0 2023-07-21

### Features
- Introduces Thread Safe Cryptographic Materials Caches (CMCs):  
  - Storm Tracking Cache  
    Safe for use in a multi threaded environment,  
    tries to prevent redundant or overly parallel backend calls.  
    See [Spec changes](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-encryption-sdk-specification/blob/ce9a4062124edc5085c66a4f10742e15aa039b34/changes/2023-06-19_thread_safe_cache/change.md) for details.  
  - Multi Threaded Cache  
    Safe for use in a multi threaded environment,  
    but no extra functionality  

### BREAKING CHANGES
- CMCs:  
  - Original Cryptographic Materials Cache has been renamed to Single Threaded Cache  
  - `CreateCryptographicMaterialsCacheInput` now ONLY accepts `CacheType`,  
    which determines which, if any, of the three implemented CMCs will be returned.  
  - The `DefaultCache` is `StormTrackingCache`  
- `CreateAwsKmsHierarchicalKeyringInput`:  
  - no longer has a `maxCacheSize` field   
  - now has an optional `cache` field for a `CacheType`  
- Hierarchical Keyring's Key Store:  
  - The Hierarchical Keyring's Key Store's Data Structure has changed.  
    As such, entries persisted in the Key Store with prior versions of this library are NOT compatibale.  
    Instead, we recommend Creating a new DynamoDB Table for this version of the Key Store.  
  - The Key Store's `CreateKeyInput` now takes:  
    - An Optional `String branchKeyIdentifier`  
    - An Optional `EncryptionContext encryptionContext`  
      - This `encryptionContext` will be added to the Encryption Context sent to KMS prefixed with `aws-crypto-ec`  
  - Creating a Key now also calls KMS:ReEncrypt  
  - `CreateKeyStore` no longer creates a GSI  
  - The Encryption Context used with KMS' `GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext` no longer include's the discarded GSI's `status`.  
  - More details about the Key Store's changes are avaible in our Specification:  
    - [2023-07-12 Update Key Store](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-encryption-sdk-specification/tree/master/changes/2023_7_12_update-keystore-structure)
    - [KeyStore Specification](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-encryption-sdk-specification/blob/master/framework/branch-key-store.md)

### Maintenance
- A variety of fixes to the libraries CI and testing
 
### Fix
- Fixes Required Encryption Context CMM and UpdateUsageMetadata names in smithy model

## 1.0.0-preview-3 2023-06-22

### Fix
- Fixes PutCacheEntry
  - PutCacheEntry will now update an entry.
    This simplifies using the cache in concurrent situations.
    Rather than having the caller implement some retry logic
    the cache will now update the entry.
- Fixes pom.xml to include runtime version of BouncyCastle and removes bundling of BC in the jar.

## 1.0.0-preview-2 2023-06-19

### Fix
- Fixes build file to correctly generate pom file with correct dependencies during release.

## 1.0.0-preview-1 2023-06-07

### Features
- Initial release of the AWS Cryptographic Material Providers Library.
  This release is considered a [developer preview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/maint-policy.html#version-life-cycle)
  and is not intended for production use cases.
